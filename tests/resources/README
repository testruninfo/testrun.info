All files in this folder will be copied to build/test/resources during
test compilaton. This allows predefined file access for tests using:

EXAMPLE:
char *config = "./build/test/resources/config.txt";

Pathes are relative and automatically deployed to build. In addition the
resources under test/resources are included in GIT by default.
